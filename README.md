E-commerce Rest API in Nodejs

Step-1 - Set up the development environment: Install Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. You can also use a package manager like npm or yarn to install dependencies.

Step-2 - Define the API endpoints: Identify the API endpoints needed for your ecommerce application.

Step-3 - Set up the Express.js server: Create an Express.js server and define the basic routing for your API endpoints. 
You can use the express.Router() method to create modular route handlers.

Step -4 - Configure the MongoDB connection: Use the mongoose library to connect to your MongoDB database. Define the schema for your data models, and use 
the mongoose API to define CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for your models.

Step -5 - Implement API endpoint logic: Implement the logic for your API endpoints using the express routing and the mongoose data models. Use HTTP methods 
like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to handle different types of requests.

Step-6 - Add validation and error handling: Add validation to your API endpoints to ensure that the incoming data is valid.

Step -7 -Test the API: Test your API using a tool like Postman to ensure that it's working as expected.
